Please download the datasets below and put them in a folder named `data`.
In this way you can skip retrieving the data from the ACCESS-OM2 simulations and you start using the analysis scripts in the `notebooks` folder.

[Additional oceanographic variables calculated from ACCESS-OM2 output (offline)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14575540)

However, if you are interested in calculating the additional oceanographic variables offline, for which you need the scripts int the `src` folder than you have to get access to the ACCESS-OM2 model data. 
How to get access to this data can be found here:
